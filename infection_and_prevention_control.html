        Infections, those silent invaders carried by bacteria, viruses, and other unwelcome guests, 
        wreak havoc on our well-being. These tiny organisms sneak into our bodies, multiply, and 
        trigger our immune system's alarm. While some infections cause mild sniffles, others pack 
        a powerful punch, leading to serious illness.But our bodies aren't defenseless fortresses.     
        Our immune system, a complex army of white blood cells and antibodies, stands guard. It 
        recognizes these microscopic  foes and launches a counteroffensive, aiming to eliminate
        them before they cause harm. Sometimes, this battle rages silently, leaving us none the 
        wiser. Other times, the fight manifests as fever, fatigue, or localized pain, alerting us 
        to the ongoing  war within.

<section class="prev">
<h2>Here are some of the most important infection prevention measures: <br><br>Hand hygiene</h2><br>
 
<center><img src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT94WmdudumC2AtGS0SZvBmk4aRv3toVo2BQ-6k51wrNfMNcrfxC9MpY0r76RWB" height="200" width="200"></center>
<p> This is the single most important step you can take to prevent the spread of infection. Wash your hands thoroughly with 
    soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. 
    Be sure to clean your hands after blowing your nose, going to the bathroom, 
    touching animals, and before and after preparing food.

    <h2>Respiratory hygiene</h2><br>
   <p>  When you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow.
    Dispose of the tissue immediately and wash your hands. Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose, and mouth.
</p>

<h2>Personal protective equipment (PPE)</h2><br>
   <p>  In some situations, you may need to wear PPE, such as a mask, gloves, or gown, to protect yourself 
    from infection. This is especially important in healthcare settings and when caring for someone who is sick.
    Disinfection and sterilization: Regularly disinfect and sterilize surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, 
    such as doorknobs, countertops, and toys.

    <h2>Vaccination</h2><br>
    <p> Vaccines are one of the most effective ways to prevent infectious diseases. Get vaccinated according 
    to the recommended schedule for your age and health condition.

     If you are sick, stay home from work or school to avoid spreading your illness to others.
    By following these simple measures, you can help to protect yourself and others from infection.
    </p>
    <p style="color: blue;">
     It is important to note that these are general recommendations, and the specific measures you need to take may vary depending on the situation.
     For example, if you are caring for someone who is sick with a contagious disease, you may need to take additional precautions, such as wearing 
     a mask and gloves. It is always best to consult with a healthcare professional for specific guidance.</p>
